Two arguments: input and output directories

The input direcory contains the files named according to the schema

m<number1>_R_lines_<numer2>_chunk_<number3>.png

The script should rename the files in such a way that their
alphabetical order is preserved and number2 are continuous (starting
with 01).

Moreover "m" should be changed to "t", "_R_lines_" to "_l" and "_chunk_" to "g".

So the names

m01_R_lines_05_chunk_20.png
m01_R_lines_05_chunk_22.png
m01_R_lines_05_chunk_23.png

should be changed to

m19_R_lines_02.png
m19_R_lines_03.png
m19_R_lines_04.png

Moreover a statistic should be printed, which shows
- for every number1 the maximal value of number2
- for every number2 the maximal value of number3
- the total number of files.
