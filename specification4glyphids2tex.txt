Three arguments: input and output directories, metadata file 

The input direcory contains the files named according to the schema

t<number1>_l<numer2>g<number3>.png

For example

t01_l01g01.png
t01_l06g10.png

For every file construct so called glyph identifier in the following
way:

1. In the metadata CSV file find the row <number1>, eg.

01,Augezdecki-01_PT08_402.djvu,Augezdecki,01,08,402
42,Ungler1-01_PT03_112.djvu,Ungler1,01,03,112
53,Ungler2-02_PT05_240.djvu,Ungler2,02,05,240

Create a two letter symbol based on the column 3: for `Ungler1' it is
`U1', for `Ungler2' it is `U21', for all values the symbol is just the
first 2 leeter, e.g for `Augezdecki' it is `Au'. Next concatenate the
symbol with `-<numer1><number2><number3>'.

The result is references later as the glyph id.

For every prefix t<number1> please create a Python script named
t<number1>_glyphids.tex with the content described below.

1. Preamble

\glpismo


2. Postamble

//
%%% Local Variables:
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-engine: luatex
%%% TeX-master: shared
%%% End:

3. The proper content

For every file created two lines

% <running number of the file staring with 1>
{\PTglyphid{<glyph id>}}

Here is a fragment of t01_glyphids.tex file

------- cut here -----
\glpismo
% 1
{\PTglyphid{A-010101}
% 2
{\PTglyphid{{A-010102}
//
%%% Local Variables:
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-engine: luatex
%%% TeX-master: shared
%%% End:
------- cut here -----

The alphabetic order of file should be preserved.
